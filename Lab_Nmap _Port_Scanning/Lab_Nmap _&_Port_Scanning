# In this Lab I will practice using Nmap as a network scanning and security auditing tool.

#!/bin/bash
# Simple nmap scan script for localhost
# Author: Sofiia Veleska
# Description: Scans ports and detects service versions on localhost 127.0.0.1

# Update packages
sudo apt-get update

# Install nmap 
sudo apt-get install nmap -y

# Scan ports from 1 to 10000 on localhost
nmap -p 1-10000 127.0.0.1

# Result:
# PORT     STATE SERVICE
# 22/tcp   open  ssh       # Port used for secure remote access
# 3001/tcp open  ssl       # Port possibly used for web development or a custom app

# Protocol Explanation: TCP vs UDP
# TCP:
# - Ensures data accuracy
# - Requests retransmission if packets are lost
# - Ideal for applications like web browsing, banking, file transfers apod.
#
# UDP:
# - Much faster than TCP
# - Preferred for real-time applications (live streaming, online games apod.)
# - Less reliable

# Scan localhost for service versions
nmap -sV 127.0.0.1

# Result:
# PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
# 22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.9p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu0.10 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
# 3001/tcp open  ssl/nessus?     # Unknown or custom service
